        <h2>Is there a Strategy or What is a Chance?</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Traditional game with three items: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                What is the probability of winning a game of rock-paper-scissors (BPS)? One in three, the statistics
                say. But that's only if you choose one of the three at random. But the algorithm of the human game is
                not random - people play by a certain strategy. And by solving it, you can greatly increase your chances
                of winning. A group of Chinese mathematicians, experts in game theory, did just that. They found that
                when people win, they tend to repeat a winning strategy. If they lose, they most often change their
                choice.
                <br>
                <br>
                The results were obtained after analysing games at a major tournament at Shenzhen University in China.
                The Chinese researchers gathered 360 students and divided them into groups of six. Each participant
                played 300 games against members of their group. The winners were rewarded financially - depending on
                the number of wins. Classical game theory suggests that participants in games should follow the strategy
                of random choice: thus, moves will be completely unpredictable and unexpected for opponents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Indeed, in the Chinese tournament, all players on average chose "rock", "scissors" and "paper" in equal
                numbers. However, the organisers also noticed different patterns of strategies determining the eventual
                winners and losers. Having won one game, for example, with "rock", the player repeated his choice in the
                next round. In case of defeat, players constantly made a different move, for example losing one game
                with a "stone" and choosing "paper" in the next.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Standard game with five items: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock</h3>
        <div> 
            <p>
                In the standard version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, each player has an equal probability of
                winning, losing, or drawing on each turn. This means that the chance of winning is 1/3 or approximately
                33.33%, the chance of losing is also 1/3 or approximately 33.33%, and the chance of a draw is 1/3 or
                approximately 33.33%.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, it's important to note that the probabilities can change based on the strategy and behaviour of
                the players. For example, if one player is consistently choosing one option over the others, the other
                player may be able to adjust their strategy and increase their chances of winning. Additionally, if the
                players are not choosing their options randomly, the probabilities can be skewed.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, with the addition of two new options, the chances of
                winning, losing, or drawing are no longer equal for all options. The game now has a total of five
                options, and each option has a different probability of winning, losing, or drawing against the other
                options.
                <br>
                <br>
                Assuming that each player is choosing their options randomly and independently, the probability of
                winning with a particular option can be calculated as follows:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The chance of winning against one specific option is 2/5 or 40%.</li>
                    <li>The chance of losing against one specific option is also 2/5 or 40%.</li>
                    <li>The chance of drawing with one specific option is 1/5 or 20%.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For example, if a player chooses "Scissors", their chance of winning against "Paper" or "Lizard" is
                    40%, but their chance of losing against "Rock" or "Spock" is also 40%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that the probabilities can still be affected by the strategies and behaviours
                    of the players. Players who can predict or influence the choices of their opponents can increase
                    their chances of winning.
                </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Just out of curiosity: Are there tactical differences depending on a sex of the player?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                There is no evidence to suggest that there is a tactical difference between the male and female approach
                to playing Rock Paper Scissors, or any other game for that matter. The strategies and tactics used by
                players are typically based on factors such as the player's experience, knowledge of the game, and
                ability to predict or influence their opponent's choices.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, it's important to note that there may be differences in the way that individuals approach games
                based on cultural or social factors. For example, some cultures may place more emphasis on cooperation
                and fairness, while others may emphasize competition and winning. These cultural differences can
                influence the way that individuals approach games and make decisions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, research has shown that men and women may have different preferences when it comes to
                playing games. For example, studies have found that men are more likely to prefer competitive games,
                while women are more likely to prefer cooperative games. However, these preferences do not necessarily
                translate into differences in tactics or strategies when playing a specific game like Rock Paper
                Scissors.

        <h3>Is it possible to beat a computer?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                When playing Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock against a computer, there are a few tactics that you can
                use to increase your chances of winning:
            </p>
            <br>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    Look for patterns: While the computer's choices may seem random, they may actually be following
                    a pattern. Pay attention to the computer's choices and look for any repeating sequences or
                    patterns that you can use to your advantage.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Use psychology: Just like with human opponents, you can use psychology to try to predict the
                    computer's choices. For example, some people tend to favour one option over the others, so you
                    can try to
                    anticipate the computer's preference and counter it.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Be unpredictable: To throw off the computer, try to be as unpredictable as possible. Mix up your
                    choices and avoid falling into a predictable pattern that the computer can exploit.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Use probability: Since each option has a different probability of winning, losing, or drawing,
                    you can use probability to your advantage. For example, if the computer has been choosing "Rock"
                    frequently, you may want to choose "Paper" since it has a higher chance of winning against "Rock.â€œ
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    React quickly: When playing against a computer, you may have a limited amount of time to make
                    your choice. Be prepared to react quickly and make your choice confidently without
                    second-guessing yourself.
                </ol>
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
                Remember, there is no guaranteed way to win at Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock since the outcome is
                ultimately based on chance. However, by using these tactics, you can increase your chances of
                winning and improve your overall performance against a computer opponent.
