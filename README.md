## Overview

Welcome to my website **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**. This website is Portfolio Project 2 (JavaScript Essentials) of five Milestone Projects required to complete the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development with The Code Institute.

**Project purpose**: Presentation of interactive data.

**Required**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

**The main requirement** of this project is to build an interactive front-end site applying all of the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

**The site should** respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

This website, an extended play on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, now including the dimensions of the Lizard and Spock to add an extra level of strategy and fun! 

I really hope that, my approach not only provides a new take on this well-loved game, but also delivers an immersive experience designed to help you unwind and destress. I tried to offer a calming environment replete with soothing classical music and serene nature-based backgrounds.

## Reasons behind design
**The Power of Nature**: Research has shown that exposure to nature, even through images, can lower stress levels, improve mood, and enhance mental well-being. That's why I've incorporated beautiful, calming backgrounds inspired by macro nature photography into my game. These tranquil images can help create a serene gaming atmosphere that promotes relaxation and mindfulness.

**The Magic of Classical Music**: Classical music has long been recognized for its ability to soothe the mind and lift the spirits. Certain pieces can even help improve concentration and creativity. That's why I've included a collection of classical music pieces for you to choose from while playing the game. Let the music transport you to a world of calm and tranquility.

**The Sensory Combination**: Combining the visual beauty of nature and the harmonious sounds of classical music creates a unique sensory experience that can significantly enhance your relaxation. As you play the game, you're not just engaging your problem-solving skills, you're also immersing yourself in an environment designed to reduce stress and promote positive emotions.

A comprehensive "About" page accompanies my gameplay interface. Dive into the fascinating world of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock and learn about its history, philosophy, educational significance, logical underpinnings, tactical nuances, and much more!

## **FEATURES WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE**

-  **Logo Image** next to Discover Amber Logo corresponding with website's favicon. This is should be an easy fix, but I was not able to find that fix despite multiple  
   different attempts 
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/favicon_logo_discover_amber.webp)

   - Just, as I writing this lines, decidet to try again. Below is the results:
     - The navigation tabs moved to the line under the nav-bar. 

   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue.webp) 
   
     - The 'hamburger' menu background with the content displaysed on all screen sizes, for some widths worth than others. 
       The decision has been made to return back to previous layout and work on the improvement at the later date.
   
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_1.webp) 
   <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery" width="60%">
   
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_2.webp)

- **History Page** - the original design of the website, until last few days before the Project dead line, contained four animated panels on the Landing Page. Realising that I have over estimated my abilities, experience and personal circumstances, I had to take note of advice and 'cut down' on the volume of the website. As the History Page was not quite finished, I made a decision to save it for the later development. The page originally meant to contain natural history of the amber, physical and chemical properties; information about amber inclusions and value they present to the modern scientist.
   ![Histori_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history_home.png)

   ![History_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history.png)    

- **Scrolling Background** - I would like to learn how to stop background to scroll behind 'hamburger' menu when the latter is in use. I have studied some resources and tried to implement few suggestions, but the issue is still remaining.

   ![scrolling_background](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/scrolling_background.png) 

- **Language Button** - there are few reasons I would liked to add a Language button to my website:
  - Amber is mined in many regions of the world, but the largest deposit is on the Baltic Sea, in the Kaliningrad region. The Kaliningrad Amber Combine is the only official amber mine in Russia and accounts for 65% of the global amber market. Region holds 90% of the world's extractable amber. Also, it is a popular tourist region and widely visited by tourists from many countries, the local users can find the website useful and interesting too.
  -	Perhaps, it would be beneficial to the users from other non-English speaking countries to be able to have choice of a language.
  -	As a bilingual speaker, I am proud of my roots and love my first language. English is not my first language and I would like to share my progress in this Course with my family and friends, but not all of them are fluent in English.

- **Usage Page** - taking in concideration the aim of this project and the time given, I have only mentioned a tiny fraction of the areas where humans found aplication for amber. There is still so much I would like to share with the user. Amber has been used by humans since ancient times. It is studied by geologists, palaeontologists and geochemists. The use of amber in medicine, cosmetology, pharmacology and perfume industry deserves a separate website! Also, there are many legends and folks’ stories about the amber.

- **Gifts Page** - perhaps, can be improved as well be providing user with the links to the websites where they can find products displayed in the gallery. Also, due to the many reasons, I was not able to provide every image with the description. Hence, that can be added at a later stage.

Also, I would like to address the following: 
   - There is corsoure pointer abailable on a screen when using Gifts' Page gallery. That aid user intuitevelly know that there is something to check/click.
   - Unfortunatelly, when exploring Gifts' Page gallery on a mobile device, there are no obveouse clues that there is the content at the back of some images. 
         
## **DESIGN**

-   ### Imagery

    -  The images for the *Landing Page* have been chosen as they are eye-catching, sutable thematically, perfect colour vise and intriguing/inviting to discover what connecting them to amber. These images help to keep page simple, slick and inviting to explore. 

    -  *Gifts Page* - a special consideration has been given to the images on this page. To follow the general style of the website and continuity, images were chosen on a white background. On it's turn that dictated some styling difficulties. After adding appropriately selected background colour and creating masonry gallery, I have realised that the page looks like ordinary Google search page. The aim was to provide user with unusual, original, exciting (even for the familiar with amber user) and useful information. That is how the idea of the gallery of the images with descriptive information at the back was born.  
   
-   ### Colour Scheme

    -  Amber is a fossilized resin that can vary in colour, ranging from yellow to brown to reddish orange. The colour of amber is influenced by the type of tree it came from and the location where it was formed, as well as other factors such as the presence of impurities and the amount of time it has been exposed to sunlight. 
    
    -  Rare amber colours include green, blue, and violet. These colours are caused by the presence of different impurities in the resin, such as iron, copper, or chlorine. Blue and green amber are highly prized for their rarity and beauty. These colours are often found in smaller pieces and are therefore more expensive than the more common yellow to brown ambers.

    Above facts had influence on my decisions when I was selecting images, specifically Landing Page once, deciding on the colours of navigation bar buttons and 'hamburger' menu background.

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_2.webp) 

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_3.webp)

    Initially, I have chosen colours intuitively. Then, I have used ColorPick Eyedropper and Color Picker from Chrome, and image with multicoloured amber to check if my choice was a good one. 

    Also, I have used to check my colour palette inspiration by using ColorSpace - Color Palettes [Generator_and_Color_Gradient_Tool](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23E4782B&sub=1)

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice.webp)

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/amber_2.jpg) 

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_1.webp)
   
-   ### Typography

    -   Google Fonts were used to import Oswald and Montserrat fonts into styles.css.  
    -   These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.
    -   At the start of the design I tried to choose fonts Google Fonts manually, but found this approach impractical and time consuming. I can recall that whilst working on Love Running project in one of the videos Google Font had feature of paring fonts. Unfortunately, this function is not available now (as a least, I have not been able to find it); and users have to pick fonts manually. 
    -   My student son did not approve choice of the fonts I made. Therefore, I and my son tried to research the topic of good font choices. Reading through several resources, I liked information provided at Sergei Davidov on Web Design [The_30_Best_Font_Combinations_for_Web_Design_(2022)](https://elementor.com/blog/font-pairing/)

    ![fonts_choice](./assets/image/readme_page/fonts.webp) <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/fonts.webp" width="60%">   

-   ### Wireframes

    - Though, wireframes are not mandatory in web design but they are widely used as a best practice to help clarify design goals and requirements, improve collaboration between designers and stakeholders, and streamline the design and development process.
    
    - I fully support and understand that wireframes are important for web design as they provide a visual representation of the layout and structure of a website before it is built, helping to ensure that the end product meets the design goals and requirements.

    - Unfortunately, I don't have a dissent Wireframe to produce on this occasion. This is the best I have got at the moment:

    ![Wireframe_Home](./assets/image/readme_page/wireframe_front_page.webp)

    ![Wireframe_Contact Me](./assets/image/readme_page/wireframe_contact_me_page.webp) 

    - I have researched most popular wireframe building platforms available (Balsamiq, Axure, Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, InVision Studio, Moqups, UXPin, Marvel App and
      Justinmind) and spent hours in an attempt to build my website mock-up, wireframes and website logo. In the end, I have just abundant the idea promising myself that I will master it in a less stressful and time pushing environment.

      I used the code shown in the warning to remove up-wards and down-wards pointing arrows in the telephone input field of the form. As these arrows were allowing to increase and decrease values in the input field, which is not appropreate for the telephone numbers. I have obtained the code as a result of extensive research and tried various methods to resolve the issue beforehand.

## CREDITS 

### Content 
   -  Most of the content has been researched and put together from the multiple web sites dedicated to amber. All of the information obtained has been translated from Russian language to English and presented by the developer.  
   
### Code
   - The inspiration for the 'hamburger' menu and navigation bar came after warching this video on the YouTube:
   [Nav_Bar_Hamburger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII&t=400s)  
  
   - The idea of animated panels on the Landing page has been taken from FreeFrontEnd website [Panels_Landing_Page_Image_Hover_Over_Effect](https://freefrontend.com/css-image-effects/#image-shadow-effects). Crtedits go to Mert Cukuren.

   - The solution for the Gifts Gallery images, also, came from FreeFrontEnd website [Image_Cards_Hover](https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/). Crtedits go to Luan Manara.

   - The images were downloaded from different sources, mainly from the dedicated amber websites, because there are so many, it would be too tedious to list all of them. Though, 
    I appreciate the rightful ownership of all of them.
