## Overview

Welcome to my website **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**. This website is Portfolio Project 2 (JavaScript Essentials) of five Milestone Projects required to complete the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development with The Code Institute.

**Project purpose**: Presentation of interactive data.

**Required**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

**The main requirement** of this project is to build an interactive front-end site applying all of the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

**The site should** respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

This website, an extended play on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, now including the dimensions of the Lizard and Spock to add an extra level of strategy and fun! 

I really hope that, my approach not only provides a new take on this well-loved game, but also delivers an immersive experience designed to help you unwind and destress. I tried to offer a calming environment replete with soothing classical music and serene nature-based backgrounds.

## Reasons behind design
**The Power of Nature**: Research has shown that exposure to nature, even through images, can lower stress levels, improve mood, and enhance mental well-being. That's why I've incorporated beautiful, calming backgrounds inspired by macro nature photography into my game. These tranquil images can help create a serene gaming atmosphere that promotes relaxation and mindfulness.

**The Magic of Classical Music**: Classical music has long been recognized for its ability to soothe the mind and lift the spirits. Certain pieces can even help improve concentration and creativity. That's why I've included a collection of classical music pieces for you to choose from while playing the game. Let the music transport you to a world of calm and tranquility.

**The Sensory Combination**: Combining the visual beauty of nature and the harmonious sounds of classical music creates a unique sensory experience that can significantly enhance your relaxation. As you play the game, you're not just engaging your problem-solving skills, you're also immersing yourself in an environment designed to reduce stress and promote positive emotions.

A comprehensive "About" page accompanies my gameplay interface. Dive into the fascinating world of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock and learn about its history, philosophy, educational significance, logical underpinnings, tactical nuances, and much more!

## **Possible Future Features**

I remember as a child playing the game Rock Paper Scissors with my friends. We used to play it with our hands. And up until this project, I didn't really know that there were more than three weapons in the game. I have learned that there are five weapons in the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. 

- **Even more Extended Version of the Game?**  
Creating this game was a great experience for me. I have learned that there are even more extended versions of "Rock Paper Scissors," such as the 25-gesture game "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard Cthulhu Poseidon Fire Water Air Sponge Wolf Tree Human Snake Dragon Devil Lightning Gun Chainsaw School Light darkness Dragon Monkey," where each choice has 12 others that it can beat and 12 that it can lose to.
<br>

  Such extended versions increase the complexity of the game and the number of possible outcomes, but they can also become quite hard to remember and play without a reference guide. So, while it's possible to create an even more extended version than "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock," the trade-off in complexity might outweigh the novelty or fun of the game.

<br>

- **Or, perhaps, back to Classic Game?**  
  To allow user to make a choice between the Classic, Extended and Extra Extended versions of the game. 

<br>

Furthermore, whilst thinking about the future development of the game, I am aware that it would be a right think to remember, that the key to adding new features is to always keep my target audience in mind. I need to make sure that the features enhance the relaxation aspect of the game rather than distract from it.

With this in mind, below is the list of possible Etra Features that could be  added to the game in the future:

1. **Variety of Backgrounds and Music**: Give players the ability to choose their own nature background and classical music. You could even pair certain music with certain backgrounds and label them as different "moods." For example, a "calm" mood could have a serene nature background and soothing classical music, while an "energetic" mood could have a more vibrant nature background and upbeat classical music. This would allow players to customize their experience and choose the mood that best suits them. For that reason I already equipped the game with the button "Change Mood" that allows user to change the background.
2. **Meditation or Breathing Exercises**: Between rounds, guide players through short, simple meditation or breathing exercises. This could enhance the relaxation aspect of the game.
3. **Relaxation Timer**: Implement a feature where players can set how long they want to play/relax for. After the set amount of time, the game could stop and encourage the player to take a break. This could help players avoid burnout and promote healthy gaming habits. 
4. **Game Variations**: Add different versions of Rock Paper Scissors games, like the aforementioned 25-gesture version or simpler 3-gesture version, and let players choose which one they want to play. This could be done by adding a dropdown menu where players can select the game variation they want to play.
5. **AI Difficulty Levels**: Have different levels of difficulty for the computer player, ranging from very easy to very hard. This could allow players to choose the level of challenge they want. This oprion could be added to a dropdown menu with other variations of the game (from paragraph 4) where players can select the difficulty level they want to play against.
6. **Video Tutorial**: As Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock can be complex to new players (emagine a 25-gesture version :)), having an interactive tutorial or easily accessible game rules can be helpful. This could be done by adding a button that linked to a video tutorial.
7. **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable the option for players to play with friends remotely. This could provide a shared relaxation experience. 
8. **Leaderboards**: Allow players to compete against each other or try to beat their own high scores. This could be done by adding a database to the game and allowing players to submit their scores. The scores could then be displayed on a leaderboard. 
9. **Achievements**: Create a system where players can unlock achievements based on various things like winning streaks, total wins, playing all game variations, etc. This could add a competitive element to the game and encourage players to keep playing. 
10. **Customization**: Allow players to customize their own avatar or gameboard. This could be done by adding a button that linked to a customization screen.
11. **In-Game Store**: Add a shop where players can use points earned from games to buy new backgrounds, music, or avatars. This could provide an incentive for players to keep playing and earn more points.

## **DESIGN**

### Imagery

Choice of images has been dictated by the intended purpouse of the game as well as by the desire to make the game visually appealing and interesting. 
- My choice of **background images** have been made in line with my desire to provide user oportunity to unwind and destress. I have chosen images of nature, specifically macro photography of birds' feathers, colourful fish and butterfly scales, fascinating close-ups of mushrooms, and different plants as they are known to have a calming effect on the mind and body. Some of the images I have done in my back garden; others in a near by forest. Few more images were found on the internet, and some created with the help of https://labs.openai.com/. The images are of a sutable size and quality to be easy readable and not to slow down the page loading.  

  ![Imagery](./assets/images/readme/readme-imagery/imagery-backgrounds.webp)

- My choice of **game weapons images** have been dictated by the style of the background images and style of the game. I have consciously avoided using cartoon based images as they would not be in line with the style of the game. I have chosen images of the weapons that are easy to recognise and remember. Also, special concideration has been given to colours of all weapons to insure a harmony with background images. The images are of a sutable size and quality to be easy readable and not to slow down the page loading.

  ![Imagery](./assets/images/readme/readme-imagery/imagery-characters.webp)

- The idea of **Logo** and **Fav icon** came from this page https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.html. I have chosen this image as it is simple, easy to remember and recognise. I have used Paint 3D app to adapt it to the design of the game. The image is of a sutable size and quality to be easy readable and not to slow down the page loading. 

  ![Imagery](./assets/images/readme/readme-imagery/logo-fav-icon.webp)

- Inspiration for **Modal Rules** pentagonal diagram came from this page https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/. I have chosen this image as it is compact, better sutable to fit inside of a modal. I have used Paint 3D app to adapt it to the design of the game. The image is of a sutable size and quality to be easy readable and not to slow down the page loading. 

  ![Imagery](./assets/images/readme/readme-imagery/imagery-rules-pentagon.webp)  

- Inspiration for another set of **Rules** used on About page have been found on this page https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/755449520/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-svg-png. I have used Paint 3D app to adapt it to the design of the game. The image is of a sutable size and quality to be easy readable and not to slow down the page loading.

### Colour Scheme 

The colour scheme for my website was not accidental. Choice of the colours has been dictated by the intended purpouse of the game as well as by the desire to make the game visually appealing and interesting. 

The first background image I have chosen was image of a sweet pea. To support my intuitive choice of colours I have used various tools to confirm and improve made choices. The task of creating sutable colour scheme have been challanging due to the amount of elements involved. 

My aim was to create a colour scheme that would be harmonious across of all elements involved: background images, game weapons, background colours of navigation bar, footer, game field, player's and computer's choices fields, coloures of score board and buttons, as well as moltiple messages displayed throughout the game. 

Special concideration has been given to many aspects to insure positive user experience. For example, I have chosen colours for the messages that would be in contrast with the background colours of the game field and each other, easy to read. Nav bar, footer and game field were given a sutable level of transparency to allow all elements to be easy readable, as well as allow to see main page background. 

**I have used following tools** to creat colour scheme:

- https://www.colorzilla.com Chrome extension
and
- https://mycolor.space

### Typography  

I gave a lot of thought to the choice of fonts for my website. I wanted to make sure that the fonts I chose would be easy to read and would complement the overall design of the website. I have chosen two font families: 'Cabin Sketch' and 'Montserrat' from https://fonts.google.com/.

**Reasons behind the choice of fonts:**

- I have chosen **'Cabin Sketch'** for navigation bar heading. The choice of this font is inspired by the desire to create an experience that is as comforting and familiar as a cabin in the woods, while the sketch aesthetic adds a playful and creative element. This font, with its casual yet attention-grabbing design, reinforces the website's overall theme of combining playful gaming with the tranquility of nature. The distinctive look of "Cabin Sketch" also enhances the general look of the website.

- The body text of the website employs the **'Montserrat'** font, complementing the "Cabin Sketch" used in the navigation bar heading. The pairing of these two font families has been carefully chosen to align with the website's overall aesthetic and enhance the user's reading experience.

*'Montserrat'*, a versatile and widely popular font, is known for its modern, geometric design, offering clean lines and a sleek appearance. It’s incredibly legible at both large and small sizes, ensuring that the body text of the website is clear, readable, and accessible across various devices and screen sizes. The neutrality of Montserrat makes it a perfect companion to the more distinctive Cabin Sketch, providing a balance between the playful, rustic appeal of the main website heading and the straightforward, easy-to-read body text.

While the 'Cabin Sketch' font captures users' attention and sets the mood for the website, the body's 'Montserrat' font ensures a comfortable reading and browsing experience. It successfully delivers information without distracting from the overall user experience. The combination of these two fonts supports my design goal of offering a gaming website that is both engaging and user-friendly.

Overall, the choice of 'Montserrat' for the body text and 'Cabin Sketch' for the main heading creates a visual hierarchy that is not only effective and functional, but also aesthetically pleasing. It reflects my wish to creating a website that is not only playful and engaging, but also easy to navigate and use.

### Results after the bugs fixing
   - result for index.html  
     ![HTML results index](./assets/image/readme_page/validation/final_validation/final_validation_index.webp)
     
     - there is still a warning remaining on index.html after the final validation. I was given an instruction by my mentor to change *div* to *section*.
       I don't have reason to disrespect that instruction/advice.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    - result for styles.css 
      ![CSS results 1](./assets/image/readme_page/validation/final_validation/final_css_validation.webp)
      ![CSS results 2](./assets/image/readme_page/validation/final_validation/final_css_validation_warnings.webp)

      I used the code shown in the warning to remove up-wards and down-wards pointing arrows in the telephone input field of the form. As these arrows were allowing to increase and decrease values in the input field, which is not appropreate for the telephone numbers. I have obtained the code as a result of extensive research and tried various methods to resolve the issue beforehand.

## CREDITS 

### Content 
   -  Most of the content has been researched and put together from the multiple web sites dedicated to amber. All of the information obtained has been translated from Russian language to English and presented by the developer.  
   
### Code
   - The inspiration for the 'hamburger' menu and navigation bar came after warching this video on the YouTube:
   [Nav_Bar_Hamburger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII&t=400s)  
  
   - The idea of animated panels on the Landing page has been taken from FreeFrontEnd website [Panels_Landing_Page_Image_Hover_Over_Effect](https://freefrontend.com/css-image-effects/#image-shadow-effects). Crtedits go to Mert Cukuren.

   - The solution for the Gifts Gallery images, also, came from FreeFrontEnd website [Image_Cards_Hover](https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/). Crtedits go to Luan Manara.

   - The images were downloaded from different sources, mainly from the dedicated amber websites, because there are so many, it would be too tedious to list all of them. Though, 
    I appreciate the rightful ownership of all of them.   


###  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

- I would like to thank my mentor Brian Macharia who guided me for his dedication, calmness and useful advices. I believe, that without his help and support I wouldn't be able 
  to finish this project.

- I would also like to thank my son Timothy and his friend Sam for usefull tips and testing.
