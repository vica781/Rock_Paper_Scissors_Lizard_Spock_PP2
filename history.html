        <h2>History Behind</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The history of Rock Paper Scissors is not entirely clear, but it is believed to have originated
                in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). The game was originally called "Shoushiling"
                or "hand-commanding" and was played by making different hand gestures representing objects such as rock,
                paper, and scissors.
                <br>
                <br>
                Over time, the game spread to other parts of the world, including Japan, where it became known as
                "Jan-ken-pon." In Japan,
                the game was often played to settle disputes and make decisions, and it was also used as a way to teach
                children about strategy and probability.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the Western world, the game became popular in the 20th century, and it was commonly known as "Rock
                Paper Scissors." It was often used as a way to resolve conflicts or make decisions in a fair and
                impartial way, and it also became popular as a game of chance and skill.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, Rock Paper Scissors is played around the world and has even been the subject of research in
                fields such as game theory and psychology. Its simple rules and universal appeal make it a popular
                pastime and a useful tool for decision-making.
                <br>
                <br>
                The addition of the "Lizard" and "Spock" options to Rock Paper Scissors is a more recent development,
                and it is attributed to the television show "The Big Bang Theory." In a 2008 episode of the show, two of
                the main characters, Sheldon and Raj, introduce the new options as a way to resolve a dispute.
                According to the show, the new options were created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, who were looking for
                ways to add more variety to the game. They came up with the idea of adding the "Lizard" and "Spock"
                options as a way to make the game more interesting and challenging.
                <br>
                <br>
                The new options were designed to follow the same rules as the original game, with each option beating
                two other options and losing to two other options. The "Lizard" option beats "Paper" and "Spock" but
                loses to "Rock" and "Scissors," while the "Spock" option beats "Scissors" and "Rock" but loses to
                "Paper" and "Lizard."
                <br>
                <br>
                Since its introduction on "The Big Bang Theory," the extended version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard
                Spock has gained popularity and is now played by many people around the world. It has even been used in
                competitions and tournaments, with players developing strategies and tactics to win.
