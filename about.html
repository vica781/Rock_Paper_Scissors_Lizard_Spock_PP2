    <h1>Welcome to my unique take on the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game!</h1>
    <p>
      I've added a few features to make your gaming experience more personalized and enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Background change:</strong> You'll notice a 'Change Mood' button on your screen.
      This feature allows you to choose from a variety of calming, pastel-colored backgrounds
      inspired by macro nature photography. Feeling a little more energetic?
      Or maybe you want a serene, calming environment? Just click the 'Change Mood' button and
      select the background that suits your current mood. The back and forward chevrons let you
      explore the different options; to navigate use the <i class="fas fa-chevron-left"></i> and
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Classical Music Collection:</strong> To complement your visual experience, I've also
      included a collection of classical music pieces. You can control the audio by clicking on the
      <i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> button to start the music.
      <br>
      Don't feel like listening to music? No problem! Just click on the <i class="fas fa-volume-mute"></i> button
      for some quiet playtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel like exploring the music collection further, use <i class="fas fa-chevron-left"></i> and
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> chevrons to skip through the pieces.
      And don't worry about replaying your favorite piece - once chosen, it will play in a loop until you
      decide to change it or the game is closed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> If at any point during the game you need a refresher on the rules,
      simply click the 'Rules' button to open this dialog again.
      I am here to ensure your gaming experience is seamless and fun!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      I have designed this game not only for fun but also as a refreshing break from your day.
      Here's why I believe our approach can help you recharge:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>The Power of Nature:</strong> Research has shown that exposure to nature, even through images,
      can lower stress levels, improve mood, and enhance mental well-being. That's why we've incorporated beautiful,
      calming backgrounds inspired by macro nature photography into our game.
      These tranquil images can help create a serene gaming atmosphere that promotes relaxation and mindfulness.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>The Magic of Classical Music:</strong> Classical music has long been recognized for its ability to
      soothe the mind and lift the spirits. Certain pieces can even help improve concentration and creativity.
      That's why we've included a collection of classical music pieces for you to choose from while playing our game.
      Let the music transport you to a world of calm and tranquility.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>The Sensory Combination:</strong> Combining the visual beauty of nature and the harmonious sounds of
      classical music creates a unique sensory experience that can significantly enhance your relaxation.
      As you play our game, you're not just engaging your problem-solving skills, you're also immersing yourself
      in an environment designed to reduce stress and promote positive emotions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      So, <strong>take a moment for yourself.</strong> Explore different moods with my selection of backgrounds,
      enjoy classical music collection, and let the game take you on a journey away from stress.
      Remember, this game is not just about winning or losing, it's about taking a well-deserved pause and recharging
      your mind. Enjoy the journey!
    </p>

    <h2>About - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ones more Welcome to the world of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock - an expanded,
      even more fun and strategic version of the traditional hand game that we all know and love.

    <h3>The Classic Game</h3>
    <p>
      Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) is a game with a long history, believed to have originated
      in China during the Han Dynasty (approximately 200 BC). The game made its way to Japan,
      where it became known as "Jan-ken", and eventually spread to the West. It's a game of chance,
      psychology, and strategy, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      The game was introduced to the public in "The Lizard-Spock Expansion".<strong> Rock Paper Scissors Lizard
        Spock</strong> is a game of chance that expands. It is first used to settle
      a dispute about what to watch on TV between Sheldon and Raj in
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+lizard-spock+expansion&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB929GB929&sxsrf=APwXEdexKVYfcxumVwD1UkcSKT7GISRxQQ:1684178388078&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiFi7y0hfj-AhUSilwKHY-4AlEQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1920&bih=969&dpr=1#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:1873f52e,vid:Z2Dwxv-EMTM"
        target="_blank">"The Lizard-Spock Expansion"</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      It is mentioned again in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PUEoDYpUyQ">"The Rothman Disintegration"</a>,
      where Sheldon interact with Barry Kripke over the office of a retiring professor, and they end up deciding who
      gets
      the office by playing a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Sheldon explains the rules to Barry.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The game was originally created by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".
      They submitted it to <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/en-us" target="_blank">Hasbro</a> who rejected it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      However, in 2005, they granted permission to <a href="https://www.bigbangtheory.com/" target="_blank">Bill
        Prady</a> to use the game on <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/" target="_blank">The Big Bang
        Theory</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The game is a five-weapon expansion on the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors"
        target="_blank">Rock Paper Scissors</a>. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional
      weapons: the <strong>Lizard</strong> (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and <strong>Spock</strong>
      (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie.
