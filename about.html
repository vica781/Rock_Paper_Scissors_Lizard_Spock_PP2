      <h2>History Behind</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The history of Rock Paper Scissors is not entirely clear, but it is
          believed to have originated in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BC -
          220 AD). The game was originally called "Shoushiling" or
          "hand-commanding" and was played by making different hand gestures
          representing objects such as rock, paper, and scissors.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time, the game spread to other parts of the world, including
          Japan, where it became known as "Jan-ken-pon." In Japan, the game was
          often played to settle disputes and make decisions, and it was also
          used as a way to teach children about strategy and probability.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the Western world, the game became popular in the 20th century, and
          it was commonly known as "Rock Paper Scissors." It was often used as a
          way to resolve conflicts or make decisions in a fair and impartial
          way, and it also became popular as a game of chance and skill.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, Rock Paper Scissors is played around the world and has even
          been the subject of research in fields such as game theory and
          psychology. Its simple rules and universal appeal make it a popular
          pastime and a useful tool for decision-making.
          <br />
          <br />
          The addition of the "Lizard" and "Spock" options to Rock Paper
          Scissors is a more recent development, and it is attributed to the
          television show "The Big Bang Theory." In a 2008 episode of the show,
          two of the main characters, Sheldon and Raj, introduce the new options
          as a way to resolve a dispute. According to the show, the new options
          were created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, who were looking for ways to
          add more variety to the game. They came up with the idea of adding the
          "Lizard" and "Spock" options as a way to make the game more
          interesting and challenging.
          <br />
          <br />
          The new options were designed to follow the same rules as the original
          game, with each option beating two other options and losing to two
          other options. The "Lizard" option beats "Paper" and "Spock" but loses
          to "Rock" and "Scissors," while the "Spock" option beats "Scissors"
          and "Rock" but loses to "Paper" and "Lizard."
          <br />
          <br />
          Since its introduction on "The Big Bang Theory," the extended version
          of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock has gained popularity and is now
          played by many people around the world. It has even been used in
          competitions and tournaments, with players developing strategies and
          tactics to win.

      <h2>Is there a Strategy or What is a Chance?</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Traditional game with three items: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          What is the probability of winning a game of rock-paper-scissors
          (BPS)? One in three, the statistics say. But that's only if you choose
          one of the three at random. But the algorithm of the human game is not
          random - people play by a certain strategy. And by solving it, you can
          greatly increase your chances of winning. A group of Chinese
          mathematicians, experts in game theory, did just that. They found that
          when people win, they tend to repeat a winning strategy. If they lose,
          they most often change their choice.
          <br />
          <br />
          The results were obtained after analysing games at a major tournament
          at Shenzhen University in China. The Chinese researchers gathered 360
          students and divided them into groups of six. Each participant played
          300 games against members of their group. The winners were rewarded
          financially - depending on the number of wins. Classical game theory
          suggests that participants in games should follow the strategy of
          random choice: thus, moves will be completely unpredictable and
          unexpected for opponents.
          <br />
          <br />
          Indeed, in the Chinese tournament, all players on average chose
          "rock", "scissors" and "paper" in equal numbers. However, the
          organisers also noticed different patterns of strategies determining
          the eventual winners and losers. Having won one game, for example,
          with "rock", the player repeated his choice in the next round. In case
          of defeat, players constantly made a different move, for example
          losing one game with a "stone" and choosing "paper" in the next.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>
        Standard game with five items: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          In the standard version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, each
          player has an equal probability of winning, losing, or drawing on each
          turn. This means that the chance of winning is 1/3 or approximately
          33.33%, the chance of losing is also 1/3 or approximately 33.33%, and
          the chance of a draw is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, it's important to note that the probabilities can change
          based on the strategy and behaviour of the players. For example, if
          one player is consistently choosing one option over the others, the
          other player may be able to adjust their strategy and increase their
          chances of winning. Additionally, if the players are not choosing
          their options randomly, the probabilities can be skewed.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, with the addition of
          two new options, the chances of winning, losing, or drawing are no
          longer equal for all options. The game now has a total of five
          options, and each option has a different probability of winning,
          losing, or drawing against the other options.
          <br />
          <br />
          Assuming that each player is choosing their options randomly and
          independently, the probability of winning with a particular option can
          be calculated as follows:
          <br />
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The chance of winning against one specific option is 2/5 or 40%.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chance of losing against one specific option is also 2/5 or 40%.
          </li>
          <li>The chance of drawing with one specific option is 1/5 or 20%.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, if a player chooses "Scissors", their chance of winning
          against "Paper" or "Lizard" is 40%, but their chance of losing against
          "Rock" or "Spock" is also 40%.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that the probabilities can still be affected by
          the strategies and behaviours of the players. Players who can predict
          or influence the choices of their opponents can increase their chances
          of winning.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>
        Just out of curiosity: Are there tactical differences depending on a sex
        of the player?
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          There is no evidence to suggest that there is a tactical difference
          between the male and female approach to playing Rock Paper Scissors,
          or any other game for that matter. The strategies and tactics used by
          players are typically based on factors such as the player's
          experience, knowledge of the game, and ability to predict or influence
          their opponent's choices.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, it's important to note that there may be differences in the
          way that individuals approach games based on cultural or social
          factors. For example, some cultures may place more emphasis on
          cooperation and fairness, while others may emphasize competition and
          winning. These cultural differences can influence the way that
          individuals approach games and make decisions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, research has shown that men and women may have different
          preferences when it comes to playing games. For example, studies have
          found that men are more likely to prefer competitive games, while
          women are more likely to prefer cooperative games. However, these
          preferences do not necessarily translate into differences in tactics
          or strategies when playing a specific game like Rock Paper Scissors.

      <h3>Is it possible to beat a computer?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          When playing Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock against a computer,
          there are a few tactics that you can use to increase your chances of
          winning:
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          <ol>
            Look for patterns: While the computer's choices may seem random,
            they may actually be following a pattern. Pay attention to the
            computer's choices and look for any repeating sequences or patterns
            that you can use to your advantage.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Use psychology: Just like with human opponents, you can use
            psychology to try to predict the computer's choices. For example,
            some people tend to favour one option over the others, so you can
            try to anticipate the computer's preference and counter it.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Be unpredictable: To throw off the computer, try to be as
            unpredictable as possible. Mix up your choices and avoid falling
            into a predictable pattern that the computer can exploit.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Use probability: Since each option has a different probability of
            winning, losing, or drawing, you can use probability to your
            advantage. For example, if the computer has been choosing "Rock"
            frequently, you may want to choose "Paper" since it has a higher
            chance of winning against "Rock.“
          </ol>
          <ol>
            React quickly: When playing against a computer, you may have a
            limited amount of time to make your choice. Be prepared to react
            quickly and make your choice confidently without second-guessing
            yourself.
          </ol>
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>
          Remember, there is no guaranteed way to win at Rock Paper Scissors
          Lizard Spock since the outcome is ultimately based on chance. However,
          by using these tactics, you can increase your chances of winning and
          improve your overall performance against a computer opponent.
