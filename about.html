    <h1 id="aboutPage_h1">Welcome to my unique take on the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game!</h1>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      I have designed this game not only for fun but also as a refreshing break from your day.
      Here's why I believe my approach can help you recharge:
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      <strong>The Power of Nature:</strong> Research has shown that exposure to nature, even through images,
      can lower stress levels, improve mood, and enhance mental well-being. That's why we've incorporated beautiful,
      calming backgrounds inspired by macro nature photography into our game.
      These tranquil images can help create a serene gaming atmosphere that promotes relaxation and mindfulness.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      <strong>The Magic of Classical Music:</strong> Classical music has long been recognized for its ability to
      soothe the mind and lift the spirits. Certain pieces can even help improve concentration and creativity.
      That's why we've included a collection of classical music pieces for you to choose from while playing our game.
      Let the music transport you to a world of calm and tranquility.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      <strong>The Sensory Combination:</strong> Combining the visual beauty of nature and the harmonious sounds of
      classical music creates a unique sensory experience that can significantly enhance your relaxation.
      As you play our game, you're not just engaging your problem-solving skills, you're also immersing yourself
      in an environment designed to reduce stress and promote positive emotions.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      So, take a moment for yourself. Explore different moods with my selection of backgrounds,
      enjoy classical music collection, and let the game take you on a journey away from stress.
      Remember, this game is not just about winning or losing, it's about taking a well-deserved pause and recharging
      your mind. Enjoy the journey!
    </p>

    <h2 id="aboutPage_h2">Game Features</h2>

    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      I've added a few features to make your gaming experience more personalized and enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      <strong>Background change:</strong> You'll notice a 'Change Mood' button on your screen.
      This feature allows you to choose from a variety of calming, pastel-colored backgrounds
      inspired by macro nature photography. Feeling a little more energetic?
      Or maybe you want a serene, calming environment? Just click the 'Change Mood' button and select the background
      that suits your current mood. The back and forward chevrons let you
      explore the different options; to navigate use the <i class="fas fa-chevron-left"></i> and <i
        class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> buttons.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      <strong>Classical Music Collection:</strong> To complement your visual experience, I've also
      included a collection of classical music pieces. You can control the audio by clicking on the

    <h2 id="aboutPage_h2">About - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock</h2>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a fun and strategic expansion of the traditional hand game we all know and
      love - Rock, Paper, Scissors.
    </p>
    <h3 id="aboutPage_h3">The Classic Game</h3>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      The classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) has a rich history, believed to have originated in China during
      the Han Dynasty (around 200 BC). The game, known as "Jan-ken" in Japan, eventually made its way to the West. It's
      a game of chance, psychology, and strategy, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers
      rock.
    </p>
    <h3 id="aboutPage_h3">The Extended Version</h3>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      The extended version - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock - was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. This
      expansion introduces two new elements: Lizard and Spock, increasing the game's complexity and reducing the chances
      of a round ending in a tie. Despite its initial rejection by <a id="aboutPage-link"
        href="https://www.hasbro.com/en-gb" target="_blank">Hasbro</a>, the game found its fame when it was popularized
      by "The Big Bang Theory", a hit
      television series, in 2005. Bill Prady, the show's producer, was granted permission by Kass and Bryla to use the
      game on the show.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      The game was first introduced to the public in an episode of "The Big Bang Theory" titled <a id="aboutPage-link"
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+lizard-spock+expansion&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB929GB929&sxsrf=APwXEdexKVYfcxumVwD1UkcSKT7GISRxQQ:1684178388078&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiFi7y0hfj-AhUSilwKHY-4AlEQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1920&bih=969&dpr=1#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:1873f52e,vid:Z2Dwxv-EMTM"
        target="_blank">"The Lizard-Spock Expansion"</a>. In this episode, the characters Sheldon and Raj use the game
      to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV. Later on, in the episode <a id="aboutPage-link"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PUEoDYpUyQ">"The Rothman Disintegration"</a>, Sheldon explains the rules
      of the game to Barry Kripke as they decide who gets the office of a retiring professor by playing Rock, Paper,
      Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutPage-text">
      The game operates on the same basic principle as Rock, Paper, Scissors but includes two additional weapons: the
      <strong>Lizard</strong> (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and <strong>Spock</strong> (formed by the
      Star Trek Vulcan salute). The introduction of these new elements reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie,
      making the game even more exciting and strategic.
